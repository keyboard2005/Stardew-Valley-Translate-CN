  "Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Spring.5": "The cleaner shrimp in my aquarium are such pigs at feeding time. I have to cover up the corals so that they don't get their food stolen from them!$1#$b#Wild cleaner shrimp will remove parasites from the mouths and bodies of client fish who wait patiently for their turn - even much larger predators. I love that sort of mutualism.$3",

  "Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Spring.8": "*Sigh* Eli managed to drop one of our last best mugs and get coffee on my paperwork this morning. It's a good job that I didn't get very far.$2#$b#I can't get upset at him for long, though. He always looks like a kicked puppy, I had to calm him down and let him know I still love him.$0",
  "Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Spring.9": "Eli found a few shark teeth in one of the caves he started exploring. I need to compare them with those of known sharks, but I've never seen this species!$6#$b#They must be prehistoric. He's excited to know if they'll name this shark after him if my hunch is right. We'll see. I'll have to show Demetrius and Maru first.$1#$b#And we'd have to try and find the rest of it, of course.$3",
  "Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Spring.10": "Hello, @. I've just recovered from a particularly nasty migraine. I'm going to have to apologize to Eli for snapping at him when he kept trying to fuss over me.$2#$b#He means well, but you've heard how loud he is at the best of times - his default volume drowns out nearby jet engines. I hope he isn't upset with me.$9",
  "Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Spring.11": "Maru invited me out the other night to go stargazing with her. There's no light pollution here in the Valley, so you can see the night sky in all its glory.$1#$b#We ended up getting a great view of the Stardrop constellation! It makes you wonder.

You get the picture.$9#$b#I used to have to concentrate hard to understand them, but over the years it got easier.

And honestly, I get really nervous behind the wheel - I find other drivers unpredictable.$9#$b#Eli can also drive, but I'm even more nervous when he's the one doing it. He thinks that speed limits are a polite suggestion. How he passed his test, I'll never know.$7",
  "Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Spring.16": "I ended up visiting the library while class was in session and the kids started grilling me for facts on sharks and how to avoid an attack.$0#$b#The vast majority of sharks have no interest in eating humans. When they DO bite, it's usually curiosity or because they mistook us for their natural prey.$1#$b#Then Vincent asked if you can stop a shark by punching it in the nose.

  "Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Summer.2": "If you're into fishing, you might find a pufferfish if you're lucky! They're quite active at this time of year.$1#$b#Just don't ever try eating one. Tetrodotoxin poisoning is a nasty way to go.$9#$e#And watch your fingers, because they have a powerful bite.$0",
  "Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Summer.3": "Hey, @. Hope you've been sleeping better than I have.$0#$b#The heat's bad enough without Eli's snoring. They can probably hear him from the other side of town.$2",

  "Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Summer.5": "A few days each Summer, the ocean water turns bright green. It's caused by phytoplankton blooms that coincide with the crab mating season.$1#$b#You'll find a lot of coral and interesting shells washed up on the beach during this time.$3",

I worry about him going out in the dead of night.$9",
  "Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Summer.8": "I get that dust sprites hate the Summer heat, but that's no excuse for Soot to get into our fridge.

  "Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Summer.11": "I saw a Crimsonfish recently at the eastern pier of the town's beach. They're a very rare find and a protected species!$3#$b#Most of the year they're found in the open ocean miles away from any shore, but during Summer they visit the shallows to spawn.$1",
  "Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Summer.12": "I'm not sure what's worse. The stench when Eli gets back from an adventure covered in mud and slime, or his new cologne.$9#$b#Is he trying to impress people or put them in a coma?$3",

  "Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Summer.14": "I rarely go to Cindersap Forest, but Eli dragged me out for a walk there the other day.

It's really quite nice.$1",
  "Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Summer.15": "I think I should try exercising more often. I go out pretty much all the time, but it's not quite the same.

  "Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Summer.17": "Nice weather, isn't it? I think Rosa's planning another neighbourhood barbeque soon, and you can bet that I'll be in attendance.$3#$b#Rosa's cooking is always wonderful. She has this knack for knowing exactly how everybody likes theirs done.$1",
  "Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Summer.18": "If I'm not mistaken, the percula clownfish in my aquarium are getting ready to spawn soon! I'll need to prepare a small tank for the fry to live in.$3It's always a warm feeling when you realise that your pets are reproducing. It's how you know that you're doing a great job of keeping them happy.$1",
  "Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Summer.19": "I had a pretty rough day yesterday because of a splitting migraine. Soot stayed with me most of the time though - like he wanted to comfort me.$0#$b#He can be sweet when he wants to. I know I moan about his antics a lot, but he's not all bad, you know?$1",

Salt on the threshold, avoid black cats on your path, that sort of thing.$0#$b#I don't really understand the occult, but Eli's an encyclopedia on it. Let's say I've experienced some really inexplicable things before.$9#$e#Spend enough time around him and you'll know what I mean. He's like a magnet for the bizarre.$0",
  "Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Fall.2": "Willy occasionally takes me out on his boat, but I wish I had one of my own.$0#$b#Actually, no. I wish I had a submarine like the one at the Night Market. It would be scary, but fun.$3",
  "Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Fall.3": "Sea cucumbers become common at this time of year.

No other animal can do that!$3",
  "Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Fall.4": "Fall's great for camping. We sometimes go into the mountains or on the beach for a nice evening out.$3#$b#Eli's got a massive collection of horror stories. They're definitely more atmospheric when told under the stars.$1",
  "Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Fall.5": "Do I relax with some games later or continue writing my paper on the dioecy of local Hydrozoan species?$0#$b#Who am I kidding? Stupid question. Junimo Kart can wait a little longer.$3",
  "Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Fall.6": "Are you into video games, @? Eli and I are both pretty avid gamers. I managed to get the last achievement in {{GameName}} yesterday!$1#$b#It was one of those really obnoxious ones as well, but it was so satisfying to finally hit 100% completion. I'll probably end up replaying it sooner or later.$3",
  "Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Fall.7": "I'm trying to devise a new puzzle for Penelope the Octopus. They're intelligent creatures that enjoy challenges, such as food in jars they need to unscrew.$3#$b#Unfortunately, she also employs that intelligence against me on a regular basis. They are master escape artists - keeping her in the aquarium is like a game between us both.$1",
  "Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Fall.8": "I've got to order more nitrate, pH and calcium test kits soon. When keeping a reef aquarium you have to keep a close eye on a lot of water parameters.$0#$b#It's a delicate balancing act, especially with smaller ones like my nano tank where fluctuations happen faster.$1",
  "Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Fall.9": "Eli commissioned a painting from Leah ages ago, but I only saw it once when he brought it home. I've no idea where he put it. I didn't think he was into art.$0#$b#Not that I'm fussed... it was oddly ominous to look at and nothing like Leah's usual subject matter. No offence to her, of course.$9",
  "Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Fall.10": "Eli and I had a discussion about aliens recently. We both think they're real - the chances of our planet being the only habitable one are simply too low.$1#$b#But I was thinking - if we're seeing the stars as they appeared millenia ago because it takes light so long to reach us, what does that mean for alien signals sent our way?$9#$b#Would those aliens even still be around by the time we heard their message? I think I gave Eli an existential crisis with that question.$0",
  "Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Fall.11": "Fall's a really cosy season, don't you think? Crisp, cool air and earlier evenings. It's particularly nice here in the Valley.$1#$b#Eli loves to break out the horror movies at this time of year.$3",
  "Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Fall.12": "Did you know that there's a rare anglerfish species that migrates upriver around this time of year? It's very unusual.$3#$b#Willy reckons he's seen one visit the town river, but he's failed to catch it. Good luck if you try.$1",
  "Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Fall.13": "Fall's always profitable for a {{LPJobTitle}}, right? We're looking forward to buying a pumpkin or two from you.$3#$b#I hope you're not overworking yourself, though. Your health should always come first.$1",
  "Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Fall.14": "It gets a bit nippy at this time of year on Willy's boat, but I take any opportunity I can to get out there when he offers to take me.$0#$b#We saw a pod of orcas last time that came remarkably close to us. Later I'll have to show you the photos I took.$3",

  "Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Fall.16": "I heard something rummaging around outside our house last night when I was watching a movie with Eli. I asked him to check - I mean, he's the one with a sword.$2#$b#He said it was just a raccoon, but I'm not so sure. I know perfectly well that there's monsters around the Orchard not far from our house!$6",
  "Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Fall.17": "*Sigh* We have an apocalypse drill scheduled later tonight. Eli's planned out exactly where we'll go and what we'll do in the event of a zombie outbreak.$9#$b#He takes this sort of thing very seriously. I'll go along with it, as long as he isn't allowed to get his hands on a firearm of any kind. Knowing him, he'd maim himself with it.$2#$b#Also, I'm not to tell you or anyone else where his 'safehouse' is, in case any of you snap and resort to banditry after the fact. Sorry, @.$0",
  "Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Fall.18": "Sometimes Eli and I play board games when we're not busy. Last night, it was chess. I thought I'd won, but he trapped me without me even realising.$6#$b#I don't think HE realised as well until I was in checkmate. I sometimes wonder if his goofiness is just a front he puts up.$1",
  "Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Fall.19": "Has Eli been acting differently towards you lately? Like, way more energetic and excitable than usual? Talking really fast? Oh, it's nothing to be alarmed about.$0#$b#He gets like that sometimes. I don't know what the cause is, but it's not a new development.$2",
  "Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Fall.20": "I've never actually seen any of the cryptids that Eli chases, but he's convinced that they're real. And honestly, I can't prove that they DON'T exist.$0#$b#New species are discovered all the time though, so maybe there is some grain of truth to the Thresher Worms or Manticores said to live in Gotoro?",
  "Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Winter.1": "Eli thought he'd get away with throwing a snowball at my face earlier. So I shoved one right down the front of his shirt. No regrets.$3",
  "Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Winter.2": "Any good at making snowmen? I'm not too bad at it myself.$0#$b#But you should see the abominations that Eli created last year.

  "Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Winter.3": "Hi @. Bet you'll be glad to get back into the warmth later.$0#$b#I should really invest in a warmer coat for when I'm working on the beach all day.$3",
  "Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Winter.4": "It was Winter when we moved to Pelican Town from Point Drake. I wonder if it's changed much since then?$0#$b#It was nice, but I don't miss it all that much now. The small town atmosphere suits me more.$1",
  "Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Winter.5": "I might end up visiting the Inn with Eli later. And by 'visit', I mean he'll drag me there because he thinks I 'work too hard'.$9#$b#Maybe he's right. Rosa and the others aren't bad... and the place is cosy.$1",
  "Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Winter.6": "If you're lucky, you might see squid at this time of year during the night.$0#$b#They're attracted to the light of places like piers, where they dart out of the shadows to snatch prey that swims by.$1",
  "Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Winter.7": "So what do you do to keep yourself occupied during Winter? You know, you could try your hand at aquaculture.$0#$b#Different fish can be rewarding to farm if you've got ponds to keep them happy in. I can give husbandry advice if you like.$3",
  "Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Winter.8": "There's a very rare fish called the Glacierfish that's only active at this time of year.$1#$b#It's only been sighted in Cindersap Forest, where it migrates upriver each year to lay eggs on the underside of glaciers. I don't think even Willy's caught one.$3",

  "Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Winter.10": "The hardest part about Winter is getting out of bed each day. I wish I could enjoy the warmth a little longer.$0#$b#Actually, no. The hardest part is getting ambushed by Eli for a surprise snowball fight. Watch yourself, @. He'll get you when you least expect it.$3",
  "Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Winter.11": "I've got to be more careful. I managed to slip on a patch of ice in front of people earlier, it was so embarrassing!$7",
  "Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Winter.12": "Why is it that whenever this time of year comes round, they always play the exact same festive songs over and over?$0#$b#Surely someone out there is writing new ones, right? The classics get grating after a while when it's all you hear.$9",
  "Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Winter.13": "Eloise stopped by to compliment the snow goons earlier. I'm glad she sees the humour in them.$1#$b#Eli tries to outdo himself with them every year. We used to get complaints, but people seem used to it by now.$3",
  "Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Winter.14": "I almost dozed off earlier while sitting by the window and watching the snow fall over the Scarp. It's incredibly relaxing, isn't it?$1",
  "Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Winter.15": "I kept Gunther past closing time the other evening. I'd like to say it was because I was engrossed in a new book, but I was just putting off going back out.$0#$b#Hopefully he'll forgive me for wanting to stay warm and dry at this time of year.$1",
  "Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Winter.16": "What a day... I had to dunk my arm into freezing seawater to retrieve my notes after dropping them. And then I got home to find that Eli had finished off our cocoa.$2",
  "Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Winter.17": "I worry about Thistle getting cold at this time of the year. I know that crows are used to it, but still.$0#$b#She said she's good and she'll nick a scarf from someone if she has to. Not on my watch she isn't.$6",
  "Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Winter.18": "One of these years, I'm going to spend Winter in a warmer climate. I'm tired of making a spectacle of myself every time I go into town and slip on ice.$2#$b#I don't want to have to visit Harvey more than my annual checkup, thank you very much.$9",
  "Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Winter.19": "I think Eli wants to bring home one of those ridiculously massive pizzas that Gus makes for our dinner tonight. I can't think of a better way to warm up right now.$3",
  "Core.NovaDylan.5-10.Winter.20": "Pelican Town always looks gorgeous under a blanket of fresh snow during the Winter. It's very picturesque.$1#$b#It reminds me of the little model village houses that I used to see in shops at Point Drake during Winter Star sales.$3",
  "Core.NovaDylan.SigPlatonic.1": "Sig once snatched a gull out of the air when it stole my notes on the beach. I'd never seen anything like it! That was surprisingly nice of him.$6#$b#The gulls were less impressed. You should hear the obscenities they scream when they see him these days.$3",
  "Core.NovaDylan.SigPlatonic.2": "The Bears are good neighbours. I don't talk to Sergeant Bear that often and he looks rough, but he's alright. Well, until he starts making those vulgar jokes.$0",
  "Core.NovaDylan.SigPlatonic.3": "I often see Sig loitering on the beach while I'm working. I expect him to throw his cigarette ends or Joja cola cans on the ground, but luckily he never does.$0#$b#He probably knows that Gudrun would lay into him if she found out.$1",
  "Core.NovaDylan.SigPlatonic.4": "I saw Sig thoroughly engrossed in poetry at the library. I didn't think he was the sort to appreciate that kind of thing, but he seems to be an enthusiast.$0#$b#Goes to show that you shouldn't judge a book by its cover, doesn't it?$1",
  "Core.NovaDylan.SigPlatonic.5": "I was checking my phone while walking back home and walked right into Sergeant Bear. I don't know how I failed to spot that dark haired... continental landmass.$7#$b#He just smirked at me and asked if I was alright after helping me up, but I was too embarrassed to say anything. It's going to be awkward next time I see him.$2",
  "Core.NovaDylan.Sondra.1": "Having Sondra around is very much what I imagine having an aunt would be like. She dotes on practically everyone around here, not just her family.$1#$b#I'm still not used to it at all.$3",
  "Core.NovaDylan.Sondra.2": "While I was working outdoors, Sondra stopped by with a packed lunch.

I wonder if somebody else did?$9",
  "Core.NovaDylan.Sondra.3": "I think Eli's plotting to rope Sondra into helping us dodge taxes. I'll have to stop him before she agrees to do it out of the kindness of her heart.$7#$b#We have enough problems without FRS agents rappelling through our windows in the dead of night.$5",
  "Core.NovaDylan.Sondra.4": "I ended up watching three full episodes of Zuzu M.D. with Sondra at the Bear Lodge yesterday, followed by her insisting that I let her treat me to a homecooked dinner.$1#$b#I only popped round to return the game I borrowed from Gunnar last week!

  "Core.NovaDylan.GunnarGudrun.1": "I find myself apologising to Gunnar whenever he duels against my brother - I think Eli is a tad too overenthusiastic.$0#$b#Poor guy ends up on the ground more often than not. I'll have to have another word with Eli about it.$9",
  "Core.NovaDylan.GunnarGudrun.2": "I think Gunnar wants me to come over for a game night once I'm done with my work. We've mostly been playing versus, but we've been trying coop lately.$3#$b#He's got the newer, fancy consoles as well. And unlike Eli, he doesn't start whining when he loses.$1",
  "Core.NovaDylan.GunnarGudrun.3": "My GPU ended up dying on me, so I had to call off the raid I'd planned with Gunnar. It sucked, but I figured that would be the end of it.$0#$b#And then I find out that he ordered a top end replacement that's superior in every way to the one I had. Just casually handed it to me.

I dread to imagine how much it cost, let alone the ultimate streaming package they pay for.$6",
  "Core.NovaDylan.GunnarGudrun.6": "Gudrun is remarkably clever for her age. I'm usually a bit impatient around younger people, but she's great at following what I talk about.$1#$b#If she doesn't get arrested for ecoterrorism, I think she would have promise as a scientist.$3",
  "Core.NovaDylan.GunnarGudrun.7": "Eli thinks that I've been spending too much time talking to Gudrun. He claims that her juvenile speech patterns are starting to rub off on me.$7#$b#Like, excuse me? What does he know? That's, like, totally not true at all!$5",
  "Core.NovaDylan.GunnarGudrun.8": "Gudrun sometimes accompanies me while I'm working. I don't mind, since she shares my passion for what I do and makes herself useful.$1#$b#She even asks to borrow my notes so she can learn more. If only more people were as inquisitive.$3",
  "Core.NovaDylan.GunnarGudrun.9": "Gudrun was round our place while I was cleaning the aquarium, talking my ear off about that Navigator Lune show. Got to admit, it all went over my head.$0#$b#Eli teased her for her taste in TV and got shut down so hard that he was too embarrassed to say much for the rest of the visit. Serves him right.$3",
  "Core.NovaDylan.GunnarGudrun.10": "Did you know that Gudrun runs a blog about fish facts? She's really shown her work. I've contributed here and there for the sake of scientific accuracy.$3#$b#She also bullies big corporations on social media. I kind of feel sorry for the underpaid interns who have to deal with her shenanigans.$3",
  "Core.NovaDylan.Teren.1": "If it weren't for the dogtags, I'd have a hard time remembering that Teren was a soldier. I picture them more like Sig, you know? Not as outwardly friendly.$0#$b#I was a little wary of him at first, but he's hard not to like.$1",
  "Core.NovaDylan.Teren.2": "Eli seems to get on well with Teren. Granted, that's a low bar - he gets along with anyone who's not an {{LPProfanity_Asshole}}. But they hang out quite a lot.$1#$b#Hopefully he won't rope the poor guy into any trouble.$0",
  "Core.NovaDylan.Teren.3": "Teren's got rather good taste in video games. He's not a bad opponent either as it happens... he usually teams up with Eli or Sig, but that won't save any of them.$3",
  "Core.NovaDylan.Teren.4": "Teren was talking to me earlier and somehow we ended up on the subject of his poor luck with dating apps. He was asking if I... have ever had a partner.$0#$b#I've had people show interest in me before, but I've never felt those sort of emotions towards anyone. Well, not yet anyway. Sounds like a hassle, though.$9",
  "Core.NovaDylan.Teren.5": "Teren seemed to be very taken with my aquarium when he last visited. It's always nice when people take the time to appreciate the work I put into it.$1#$b#He's an animal lover, too. Next time I decide to add a fish to it, I might let him choose the species.$3",
  "Core.NovaDylan.Rodney.1": "I just had to fish up yet another autographed photo of Rodney. There's no end to the {{LPProfanity_Damn}} things! And Eli's even found them in the ground!$5#$b#*Sigh* As neighbours go he's not bad at all, but apparently his ego is big enough to have its own gravitational field. I'll have a word with him.$7",
  "Core.NovaDylan.Rodney.2": "I ended up getting accompanied by Rodney when I was working on the beach. He's always kind to me, so it was a welcome distraction.$0#$b#We wound up talking about his latest novel and by the end of it, I'd completely forgotten to collect any samples.$7",
  "Core.NovaDylan.Rodney.3": "On my way back home yesterday, I glanced up at the silo window and caught a glimpse of Rodneys's silhouette. I... don't think he was wearing anything at all?$6#$b#That's going to make the next book club meeting at the library extremely awkward...$2",
  "Core.NovaDylan.Rodney.4": "I had to tell off Thistle again for pranking Rodney. She thinks it's funny to try and drop things on his head from the sky.$7#$b#So far she's only been successful a few times, but it's just a matter of time before she gets the other crows to copy her.$5",
  "Core.NovaDylan.Rodney.5": "Rodney wants to read one of his books at our next Saturday night campfire. I don't think it's what Eli had in mind, but some variety might make it more fun.$0#$b#Rodney's stories are definitely more kid friendly than Eli's. Less likely to give you nightmares.$3",
  "Core.NovaDylan.Sen.1": "I've never seen this Sen character who Eli's friends with, but apparently he's the one who rummages through our trash at night. And he's not human.$0#$b#I thought the Shadow People are supposed to live far away from people. He sounds nice, though.$1",
  "Core.NovaDylan.Sen.2": "I found a little apology note left on our trashcan when I went to empty it. It was addressed to me... the sender said they accidentally knocked over the trash last night.$9#$b#Eli thinks that Sen wrote it. I've left my own note for him, saying it's okay and thanking him for cleaning up his mess. I wonder if he'll respond?$0#$action AddMail Current DylanSenNote received",
  "Core.NovaDylan.Sen.3": "Eli asked me if there's any books I don't mind lending to Sen. I think there's some fantasy and sci-fi books somewhere that he can take a look at.$0#$b#Maybe I should slip a few of my marine biology books in there as well.$3",
  "Core.NovaDylan.Sen.4": "I heard something moving around outside the house in the early hours and peeked out of my window just in time to see a dark figure with horns making a run for it!$6#$b#Eli thinks it's nothing to worry about, but what if they were some sort of murderous maniac trying to break in? I don't know if I'll be able to sleep tonight.$2",
  "Core.NovaDylan.Sen.5": "Eli sometimes goes out on late night excursions to meet those Shadow People. If we still had a guest room, he'd probably be trying to bring them home with him.$9",
  "Core.NovaDylan.Mateo.1": "I wasn't sure what to make of Mateo when I first met them. Seemed like your typical rough adventurer type. Then I actually spoke to them and realised...$9#$b#They're a MASSIVE nerd. One of the biggest nerds I've ever met and that's coming from me. They're an excellent DM!$3",
  "Core.NovaDylan.Mateo.2": "It's a good job that Mateo has first aid certification, because it's not uncommon for them and Eli to stagger out of the mine together covered in cuts and scrapes.$2#$b#I'd still prefer that he went to Dr. Harvey for treatment, but you won't get him in that clinic unless you literally drag him kicking and screaming.$9#$b#I speak from experience... I needed Mateo's assistance to do it once.$1",
  "Core.NovaDylan.Mateo.3": "Mateo is well known for their hatred of crabs. Not just the invasive rock crabs that attack people - crabs of all species. What a weird hangup.$9#$b#Maybe they got their toe pinched as a kid or something? Either way, I'd better not catch them hurting any.$0",
  "Core.NovaDylan.Mateo.4": "I caught Eli trying to throw knives IN THE HOUSE! He told me that Dr. Luis showed him a trick and he wanted to learn it for himself.$5#$b#I don't believe him sometimes! Clearly I need to have another word with Mateo - I don't think they realize how impressionable my brother is.$7#$b#He'll be trying to JUGGLE them next.$2",
  "Core.NovaDylan.Mateo.5": "I know it's not Dr. Luis's field of study, but I've heard great thing about the marine biology courses available at the university they went to.$0#$b#If there'd been an exchange student opportunity, I would've taken it in a heartbeat.$1#$b#I might've even seen them on campus then!$3",
  "Core.NovaDylan.Nora.1": "Nora's going to be coming over later to watch a documentary on the Fern Island marine iguanas with me. It should be interesting to the both of us.$0#$b#Eli's hopefully going to pick up one of those XL pizzas that Gus makes, I can hardly wait!$3",
  "Core.NovaDylan.Nora.2": "I might have to pay Nora a visit soon. Partly to catch up, but mostly so I have a pretext to lavish attention on Pinkie Pie and Stupid for a while.$1",
  "Core.NovaDylan.Nora.3": "I actually considered pursuing herpetology before I was serious about marine biology. In another timeline, Nora might've been my colleague.$1#$b#But if you tell her that, I'll deny it. I don't need her trying to convert me.$0",
  "Core.NovaDylan.Nora.4": "Has Eli said anything to you about Pepper Rexes lately? Because I've got the sneaking suspicion that he wants to capture one for Nora to study.$2#$b#Do I really have to remind people that this town is very flammable?$7",
  "Core.NovaDylan.Nora.5": "Sorry @, I've got a migraine flaring up at the moment. Spending too much time in the company of Eli and Nora at the same time will do that to me.$7#$b#Neither of them have an indoor voice. I swear you can hear them from the other side of town sometimes!$9",
  "Core.NovaDylan.Resort_Entering": "I can hear the parrots welcoming us to the island. They enjoy having new visitors around. Looks like a wonderful day for it!$3",
  "Core.NovaDylan.Resort": "We're very lucky to be able to visit this place. The parrots told me that they set up the resort to reward your generosity. Good on you!$3#$b#Before Ginger Island became accessible to us, I can't remember the last time Eli and I could go on vacation. We're going to cherish it.$1",
  "Core.NovaDylan.Resort_Leaving": "I had a lovely time, but I don't want to miss the boat home. I've got plenty to do later, what with going through the notes I wrote during my stay.$1",
  "Core.NovaDylan.Resort_Shore": "Goodness, I'm having a field day. I know I'm supposed to be relaxing, but I can't NOT take the opportunity to examine the sea life here!$1#$b#If only I had some snorkelling equipment, I'd be checking out the nearby reefs. Still, I'm having a great time.$3",
  "Core.NovaDylan.Resort_Wander": "The parrots endemic to this island are fascinating. They're not really used to human contact, but they're keen to learn about us and share their stories.$1#$b#Apparently that boy... Leo? They said he spent most of his life alone with them. And that he understands their speech. I hope the sight of other humans isn't alarming to him.$0#$b#Maybe I should try getting to know the kid. After all, I share a few things in common with him.$3",
  "Core.NovaDylan.Resort_Wander_2": "I know it's inevitable, but Eli had better be careful when he decides to go into that volcano. There are no medical facilities on this island.$0#$b#Unfortunately, I can't tell him to relax on the beach without sounding like a hypocrite. But the work I've been undertaking here is decidedly less lethal.$1",
  "Core.NovaDylan.Resort_Wander_3": "I had a chat with that curious bird trader further north. They barter in exchange for a random assortment of items found around here.$1#$b#I don't know what a 'Galaxy Soul' is, but they wanted 10 radioactive bars for it. I declined because I don't carry fissile material on my person.$0#$b#Yoba knows what they want it for, but I can't let Eli find out. I don't need him trying to find some in exchange for whatever that thing is.$7",
  "Core.NovaDylan.Resort_Chair": "This is the life! I'm probably going to shut my eyes for a bit and take a nap in the sunshine to the gentle lapping of the waves. It's so tranquil here.$3#$b#I never seem to get migraines while I'm here. All the more incentive to visit more often.$1",
  "Core.NovaDylan.Resort_Bar": "I'm just taking a moment to enjoy a drink before I continue collecting samples from the shore. Gus has done an excellent job with this bar.$3#$b#I hope you're remembering to stay hydrated, @. I bought extra sunscreen in case you want to borrow some.$1",
  "Core.NovaDylan.DumpsterDiveComment": "Good to see that you take recycling seriously. Might as well take it if they're going to throw it away, right?$1",

  "Core.NovaDylan.HitBySlingshot.4": "I wouldn't let my brother catch you doing that to me if I were you.$5",

  "Core.NovaDylan.divorced_twice": "I'm sorry to hear that your second marriage didn't work out... do you want to talk about it, @?$2",
  "Core.NovaDylan.fishCaught_159": "Oh hey, Willy told me that you caught a crimsonfish! I'm impressed. They are extremely strong for their size.$3",

  "Core.NovaDylan.firstVisit_TenebrousNova.EliDylan.CP_ESEDHouse": "Someone tracked dirt all across the floor I'd cleaned earlier. It was probably Eli, but he mentioned we had a visitor earlier.$0#$b#%Dylan is giving you a suspicious stare.",
  "Core.NovaDylan.houseUpgrade_1": "I saw that your house got renovated, @! Robin does a fantastic job, doesn't she?$3#$b#She worked on our house as well when she moved in - but it was far more descrepit than yours.$0",
  "Core.NovaDylan.houseUpgrade_2": "Congratulations on the house expansion! Are you planning on doing a lot of decorating? That's the really fun part.$3",
  "Core.NovaDylan.GreenRain": "Yes, I'm aware that we are experiencing anomalous weather today. Yes, I know pretty much everyone else except my brother refuses to go out in it.$0#$b#I have work to do! As long as it doesn't stain my clothes, I'm not bothered. Besides, I'm interested to see what effect it has on the sea life, if any.$9#$b#I don't even want to know what it's been doing to the guest room.$6",
  "Core.NovaDylan.GreenRain2": "Ugh, I'm not looking forward to washing my clothes. Do you know how hard it is to scrub moss out of them? And that idiot Eli insists on staying out there!$2#$b#He can wash his own clothes this time.$5",
  "Core.NovaDylan.GreenRainFinished": "The effects the green rain had on the marine wildlife seem to range from non-existent to outright beneficial.$0#$b#I've noticed an increased amount of Zooxanthellae in the tissue of the coral samples I took, which allows them to grow faster. It makes them more vibrant, too!$3#$b#The downside is that there appears to be some form of algae or moss growing on the clothes I was wearing...$9",

  "Strings.House.EDGuestRoomJournal.1": "Eli's Notes, Part 1:^^My research compels me to try to access the Void itself. Rasmodius laughed in my face when I asked him for help, but you know what they say- if you want something done properly, you've got to do it yourself. I don't mind how long it takes or how many moldering old tomes I need to look through! I suspect that the Shadow Folk originated in that impossible place - perhaps they still dwell there.^^I'm aware that this undertaking carries a huge risk. Is the Void even survivable? Will the very sight of the other side make me go insane? Will our house still be standing? Let's find out!#Have I mentioned that I have very little experience with this? The weird things that I can do are a part of me. Materialising out of thin air in the blink of an eye feels as natural as walking. But actually researching incantations and trying to prepare a ritual is a different beast altogether. I'm no real sorcerer. I have no wizardly qualifications.^^WHAT AM I DOING?#Alright, experiment number one: I've been designing a new warp totem and just finished carving the prototype. I've got to admit, it gives me the heebies. I substituted most of the hardwood for monster bone and also added some void essence (ethically sourced!) and iridium ore (a pain to get hold of). The idea is to use this thing as a sort of focus for the portal.^^Fingers crossed!",
  "Strings.House.EDGuestRoomJournal.2": "Eli's Notes, Part 2:^^The warp totem experiment went pear shaped. When I began the spells, the totem started to resonate and I could feel the atmosphere in the room starting to change. Unfortunately, the totem burned out and fell apart after a minute even as the air around it shimmered and distorted.^I definitely felt something happening. I suddenly felt cold and... empty? It's the middle of Summer but my breath was coming out as mist. And I also somehow felt stronger.^^I'm clearly on the right track!#I was reading that art can be a good catalyst for magic. Trouble is, I'm not much of an artist and neither is Dylan. If I could get a decent painting of the Void, using special pigments made from certain ingredients, I might be able to use that in combination with the warp totem! But what does the Void even look like? All I know is that it's mostly empty. Would this painting HAVE to be accurate?^^Leah waved to me when I took a walk past her cabin in the forest this morning. I wonder how much she charges for commissions?^^This could work out nicely!",
  "Strings.House.EDGuestRoomJournal.3": "Eli's Notes, Part 3:^^I think we're just about ready! Leah did an amazing job with that painting. She made this dark, otherworldly vista dotted by islands and waterfalls floating in the nothingness. It's actually rather beautiful- I hope the real Void looks something like that. Of course, I didn't tell her what I need the painting for.^^Hopefully I'll still be able to hang it on a wall somewhere once this little project is all said and done. I also made a new warp totem, hopefully a bit stronger than the last one.#I've double, triple and quadrupal checked everything. If I don't screw up, the painting will form a small, stable portal to another dimension. If not... oh, who am I kidding?^^Nothing will go wrong. I'm looking forward to telling Dylan and old Rasmodius all about my success later!#(The following was written in a hurry. You can barely make it out.)^^It worked, but not how it should've. The painting opened and I finally saw the Void. What I saw defies description. Everything I thought I knew about the world has been turned on its head. But the portal is too unstable and threatens to spill out into the house and East Scarp. I'm both extremely happy and terrified! Rasmodius knows what's going on, he teleported into the room and got to work. He looks APOPLECTIC.^^Now he's shouting at me to get out immediately so he can seal the room off and put wards on the door. And he also said to take nothing out of the room- not even you, Journal.^^I'm sorry.",
  "Strings.House.EDGuestRoomJournal.GreenRain": "Eli's Notes^^Holy {{LPProfanity_Shit}}. It's been a long time since my little experiment caused this room to be subsumed by the Void, but today, something else has taken over. Whatever this green rain is, it seems to be muting the Void's influence here. I can feel it for myself... it's absolutely there, but the plants - there are bloody TRstardEES growing in my house - have overrun everything!^^My theory is that the green rain has some sort of purifying effect, that it somehow re-anchored the guest room back into reality. I don't know how long it'll last, so I'm writing as fast as I can. I need to get out in that rain and see what's happening!#What'll happen when the rain ends, though? Will the room leave again? What'll happen to those plants when they reach the Void? Will they die there, or proliferate and turn the timeless black abyss into a lush, otherworldly jungle?^^Arghh, why did I have to screw up that ritual?! I could find answers to these questions if I could get back to the other side, I know it!^^I'm heading out to experience the green rain for myself. Eli signing off!",

They'd even steal children and raise them as their own!$1",
  "Events.EliPrototype.Question.3.Response.2": "It depends. You're thinking about the old tales where many faeries were fickle, vindictive folk.

  "Events.DylanIntro.NovaDylan.9": "Right, I've got work to do. Can't stand around chatting all day.$0#$b#But it was good to meet you, {{CPJobTitle}}. See you around.$1",

  "Events.DylanBeach.NovaDylan.2": "What is WRONG with people?$5",
  "Events.DylanBeach.NovaDylan.3": "@? Have you seen this?$2",
  "Events.DylanBeach.NovaDylan.4": "My thoughts exactly. This is going to take me ages to clean up.$9",
  "Events.DylanBeach.NovaDylan.5": "Oh, you'll help me? You're a lifesaver! That'll certainly make this go faster.$3#$b#Okay, we might as well get started. Let's go see how bad the rest of the beach is.$0",
  "Events.DylanBeach.NovaDylan.6": "Phew!",
  "Events.DylanBeach.NovaDylan.7": "Looks like that was the last of it. I seriously owe you one, @. You didn't have to do that.$1",
  "Events.DylanBeach.NovaDylan.8": "I'm going to have a word with Lewis. I'm a marine biologist, not the trash fairy. But I feel like if I don't keep the beaches clean, nobody will.$5#$b#Present company excepted, that is.$0",
  "Events.DylanBeach.Question.1": "#Lewis should be doing more to raise awareness about pollution.#It feels unfair to pin the blame on Lewis. What can he do?",
  "Events.DylanBeach.Question.1.Response.1": "I agree. I know there's only so much he can do, but surely he doesn't want his town to be a pit of squalor?$1#$b#Back in Point Drake, the problem was worse because of higher population density and apathy in the city council. But there's no such excuses here.$0",
  "Events.DylanBeach.Question.1.Response.2": "He could raise awareness about littering and pollution. Introduce small rewards for people who help clean up, and fines for the ones who make it worse.$0#$b#Or have a serious discussion with Morris about how JojaMart can be more responsible on this issue... but I feel like that one's wishful thinking.$2#$b#He can't do everything of course, but he absolutely has the power to make a positive difference.$1",
  "Events.DylanBeach.NovaDylan.9": "Thanks to you, I still have time to get some field work done. So I'll get on with that now - that macroalgae won't collect itself.$0#$b#Take care, @.$1",
  "Events.DylanBeach.Elliott.1": "As always Leah, your insight was most invaluable. I really cannot thank you enough.$0#$b#What we thought a mere love triangle is in fact a hexagon! How can our band of adventurers survive their perilous quest when hearts and loyalties stray? Delicious!$1",
  "Events.DylanBeach.Leah.1": "You know me, Elliott, I'm always happy to provide a second opinion. I can't wait to read the finished arc!$0#$b#We can't postpone the inevitable forever, though. We'd better crack on with that mess...$2",
  "Events.DylanBeach.Elliott.2": "Quite. Shall we?",
  "Events.DylanBeach.Leah.2": "...Or not!",
  "Events.DylanBeach.Elliott.3": "It would appear that we're too late.$0",
  "Events.DylanBeach.Leah.3": "So that's what Dylan and @ were doing outside while we came up with inventive new ways of emotionally tormenting your characters!$1#$b#I think we owe them for this.$0",
  "Events.DylanTown.NovaDylan.1": "Why did he have to forget his phone...?$9",
  "Events.DylanTown.NovaDylan.2": "@?$6#$b#*Sigh* I'm trying to work up the nerve to go in there. Eli said he'd meet me outside but he's not here.$9#$b#And I can't text him because he left his phone at home - again.$2",

  "Events.DylanTown.Question.1": "#There's nothing wrong with being shy, Dylan.#But I've seen you in there before.",
  "Events.DylanTown.Question.1.Response.1": "It goes beyond feeling shy - I have full blown panic attacks. It's easy for me to feel trapped and overloaded.$2",
  "Events.DylanTown.Question.1.Response.2": "Yes, but not often. And always when Eli's with me. He helps me feel grounded in situations that would overwise overwhelm me.$9",
  "Events.DylanTown.NovaDylan.4": "We've always been there for each other. But I don't want to rely on him forever, you know? It just wouldn't be fair on him.$2",
  "Events.DylanTown.Elliott.1": "Good evening. Is something the matter?$0",
  "Events.DylanTown.Leah.1": "Evening, @! And Dylan! I didn't think I'd ever see you visiting the Saloon on your lonesome.$0#$b#I'm glad! I feel like we don't see enough of you.$1",
  "Events.DylanTown.Elliott.2": "Could Eli not make it? It's most unlike him to not accompany you.$0",
  "Events.DylanTown.NovaDylan.5": "I haven't a clue where he is. He could be in there but I should really just head on home...$2",
  "Events.DylanTown.Elliott.3": "Leah, darling, would you mind popping inside in case our wayward friend is there?$1",
  "Events.DylanTown.Leah.2": "On it!$0",
  "Events.DylanTown.Elliott.4": "Forgive me for intruding, Dylan. I know that this is none of my concern...$1#$b#But I know what it's like to suffer with anxiety. I didn't always have such impeccable composure in a public setting, if you can believe it!$0#$b#If ever you find yourself in need of friendly companionship, you can always rely on Leah and myself. There is absolutely no pressure.$0",
  "Events.DylanTown.NovaDylan.6": "You mean pity friendship, don't you? That's all I need.$0",
  "Events.DylanTown.Elliott.5": "Not at all! We enjoy hearing all about your research endeavors when they take you near my shack.$0#$b#We saw you and @ cleaning up the beach. It was a task that I was dreading that day - this is the least that I can do in return.$1",
  "Events.DylanTown.NovaDylan.7": "I... I'll have to think about it. But thanks, Elliott.$1",
  "Events.DylanTown.NovaEli.1": "I said I'm sorry!",

  "Events.DylanTown.Sebastian.1": "I can't watch this.",
  "Events.DylanTown.NovaEli.2": "I screwed up, I know! I won't do it again. Please don't tell Lewis about this.$7",
  "Events.DylanTown.Sam.1": "Fight! Fight! Fight!",
  "Events.DylanTown.Abigail.1": "Shut up, Sam!",
  "Events.DylanTown.Pam.2": "'Course I won't. You can climb on Lewis's house for all I care - but not mine. Got it?$4",
  "Events.DylanTown.NovaEli.3": "Got it.$10",
  "Events.DylanTown.NovaDylan.8": "Pam, I'm sorry for whatever he did this time. If Eli broke something, we'll pay for it.$2",
  "Events.DylanTown.Pam.3": "Nothing broke, kid. Sorry you had to see that.$0",
  "Events.DylanTown.Abigail.2": "Seriously, read the room!",
  "Events.DylanTown.Leah.3": "Hey, Pam. Tell Gus that the next drink's on us, okay?$0",
  "Events.DylanTown.Pam.4": "Fine.$1",
  "Events.DylanTown.NovaEli.4": "Sweet Yoba... that was surprisingly scary! I wouldn't want to bump into Pam in a dark alley.$1#$b#Sorry about causing a scene.$10",
  "Events.DylanTown.Leah.4": "It's fine, Eli. Maybe don't go climbing on her roof in future, though?$1",
  "Events.DylanTown.NovaEli.5": "Dylan, I'm so, SO sorry I forgot my phone! I really hope you weren't stressed because of me.$2#$b#We'll cancel the Saloon trip. Let's go home and watch something you like, yeah? There might be some good documentaries on.$0",
  "Events.DylanTown.NovaDylan.9": "Eli, you don't have to - I feel guilty as it is.$2",
  "Events.DylanTown.NovaEli.6": "You haven't spoiled my evening, okay? And you are NOT a burden. I'll never think of you that way.$0#$b#All I wanted is to hang out with my little brother. I don't mind what we do at all.$1",
  "Events.DylanTown.NovaDylan.10": "Have it your way, then.$3#$b#See you all later. And thanks again for that offer, Elliott. No promises... but maybe next time I'll take you up on it.$1",

  "Events.DylanSaloon.Leah.4": "Actually, we're surprised you turned up. We'd just heard about Eli.$0",
  "Events.DylanSaloon.NovaDylan.2": "My brother's helping them drive back slimes, skeletons and who knows what else. Routine stuff for them, but still.$2#$b#My anxiety feels inconsequential in comparison. If he can do that, then the least I can do is come here for a few hours.$0",
  "Events.DylanSaloon.Emily.3": "I was just about to take everyone's orders, Dylan. Would you like anything?$1",
  "Events.DylanSaloon.NovaDylan.3": "Just water, please. I'm not much of a drinker.$1",

  "Events.DylanSaloon.Leah.6.2": "Hard agree! I almost wish we'd been there to see it at the time. But she told us all about it at the fitness class that Tuesday.$0",
  "Events.DylanSaloon.Elliott.5": "You are incorrigible, Leah.$0#$b#Let's avert our gazes, though. It wouldn't do for the good mayor to suspect his ruse is up, would it now?$1",
  "Events.DylanSaloon.Elliott.5.2": "Indeed. Perhaps we should avert our gazes, though. It wouldn't do for either of them to overhear us, would it now?$1",
  "Events.DylanSaloon.Leah.7": "More wine, Dylan? I knew you'd love it. I'm pretty sure Gus keeps it in stock just for us.$0",
  "Events.DylanSaloon.NovaDylan.5": "I probably shouldn't because I've got work to do tomorrow.$1#$b#But what the {{LPProfanity_Hell}}, I'll do it anyway! I'm having a nice time. Why stop so soon?$3",

  "Events.DylanLibrary.NovaDylan.2": "It's only awkward if you make it awkward. I should know, right? So what can I do for you?$1",
  "Events.DylanLibrary.Penny.3": "Okay, so. I've been a bit nervous about approaching you about this. I still am, actually!$0#$b#But it's been on my mind for quite a while now and I think you'd be wonderful for it...$1",

  "Events.DylanLibrary.NovaDylan.6": "Okay, you've got my interest. But I'm not exactly a public speaker, you know. Chances are they won't even listen to me.$0",
  "Events.DylanLibrary.Penny.7": "I think they might surprise you, Dylan. And perhaps more importantly, you might surprise yourself.$0#$b#You don't have to give me a definite answer now. Take some time to think it over, alright? And if it's too uncomfortable for you, I'll understand.$0",

  "Events.DylanLibrary.Penny.8": "That's all I ask. Thank you so much, Dylan!$1",

  "Events.DylanLibrary.NovaDylan.11": "I think I'll probably wind up doing it. Children learning to appreciate nature is always a net positive, right?$1",

  "Events.DylanLesson.Jas.1": "I found a sea urchin, Mister Moray!$1",
  "Events.DylanLesson.NovaDylan.10": "So you did! As we know, sea urchins are Echinoderms, which are related to starfish and sea cucumbers. They use their spines and tiny tube feet to slowly move around.$1",
  "Events.DylanLesson.Jas.2": "And they've found sea urchins in the wild that are 200 years old.$4",
  "Events.DylanLesson.NovaDylan.11": "Correct!",
  "Events.DylanLesson.NovaDylan.12": "I also see a lovely coral specimen here. Duncanopsammia axifuga, also known as the duncan coral or whisker coral. And a mushroom coral! Gorgeous finds.$1",

  "Events.DylanLesson.Eloise.1": "Yes, Mister Moray! It's a Nudibranch and some kind of pretty coral?$1",
  "Events.DylanLesson.NovaDylan.20": "Right! The coral is called Euphyllia glabrescens, or the torch coral. And well done for knowing that sea slugs are called Nudibranches!$1#$b#This species is known as the sunset Nudibranch and is endemic to East Scarp in particular, along with three other species.

  "Events.DylanMeeting.NovaDylan.5": "Gulper eels!$3",
  "Events.DylanMeeting.Demetrius.2": "Giant isopods!$1",

  "Events.DylanMeeting.NovaDylan.6": "It's awfully far down, though. There aren't many submersibles capable of reaching that depth, are there?$2",
  "Events.DylanMeeting.Maru.4": "Dad and I were discussing that. The pressure at those depths is definitely a problem, but it's a problem I think I can solve.$3",
  "Events.DylanMeeting.NovaDylan.7": "I see where this is going... are you proposing that we explore the trench ourselves?$1",

  "Events.DylanRequest.NovaDylan.1": "Good morning, @. Apologies for showing up so early, but I've got a tight schedule to keep.$0#$b#I'll get straight to the point - Maru, Demetrius and I have plans for an unmanned expedition into a newly discovered deep sea trench.$1",
  "Events.DylanRequest.NovaDylan.2": "The trouble is, the components Maru needs to design her fancy drone are expensive and we're all on a tight budget.$2#$b#We would need 5 copper bars, 5 iron bars, 5 gold bars and 3 battery packs. I know it's a big request to make...$9",

  "Events.DylanRequest.Question.1.Response.2": "Well, I definitely want to get a good look at whatever kind of life there might be at those depths.$1#$b#There could be entirely undiscovered species down there! Creatures that have quite literally never even seen the light of day.$3#$b#There's also the thrill of being the first people to lay eyes on a place that nobody could ever reach through conventional means.$1",
  "Events.DylanRequest.Question.1.Response.3": "I figured you'd say that, but you're right. It's a big thing to ask of anyone.$2#$b#We can't afford to pay you immediately, but we expect an increase in funding if we can pull this off - funding that we'll share with you.$1",
  "Events.DylanRequest.NovaDylan.3": "And naturally, we're going to give you a front row seat to the expedition. I think you'll enjoy it.$3",
  "Events.DylanRequest.NovaDylan.4": "Right, I'd better be off now. I'm sure you have plenty of things to be getting on with. Take care, @.$1",

  "Events.DylanDroneProgress.NovaDylan.3": "How long will the batteries last? It's a very long way down. Would we get much time to explore once we reached the bottom?$9",
  "Events.DylanDroneProgress.Maru.4": "Definitely enough for our purposes, but there's only so much power I can squeeze out of them - especially with the flashlight active, which we'll certainly need.$2#$b#It's either that, or coming up with a miniaturised reactor that would use radioactive bars as fuel.$0#$b#And as a nurse, I think it'd be pretty irresponsible of me to ask @ to collect fissile material!$1",

  "Events.DylanDroneProgress.Question.1.Response.1.2": "It's true, though! This venture wouldn't be possible without your technical wizardry.$3",
  "Events.DylanDroneProgress.Question.1.Response.2.1": "It handled the pressure within acceptable margins in all the simulations I ran, but the only way for us to be certain is to do it for real.$0",
  "Events.DylanDroneProgress.Question.1.Response.2.2": "Yeah... there's always a very real risk that it'll implode. But if anyone can make this work, it's Maru.$0",

  "Events.DylanDroneProgress.NovaDylan.5": "The pier outside Willy's shop should be good. It's a more central location. Anyway, I imagine we might have a bunch of onlookers.$1",
  "Events.DylanDroneProgress.Maru.6": "Deal!",
  "Events.DylanDroneProgress.NovaDylan.6": "Well, we'd better let Maru get back to her work before Harvey comes back.$1",
  "Events.DylanDroneProgress.Maru.7": "Thanks for stopping by! I'll see you in three days.$1",
  "Events.DylanExpedition.Maru.1": "Done!",

  "Events.DylanExpedition.Gudrun.2": "Sig, you'd better be watching this. You don't want to miss out!$1",
  "Events.DylanExpedition.Sigurd.1": "I'm watching it, don't worry. I'd love to see Willy tackle a ray that size.$0",
  "Events.DylanExpedition.NovaDylan.5": "So this is it... I won't lie, that actually looks terrifying from here.$6",
  "Events.DylanExpedition.Maru.5": "Right?!",
  "Events.DylanExpedition.Demetrius.3": "Well, this seems as good a place as any to make our descent into the abyss. Are you ready?$1",
  "Events.DylanExpedition.NovaDylan.6": "As ready as I'll ever be. Here goes nothing.$1",
  "Events.DylanExpedition.Maru.6": "Beginning the descent now. Please let my calculations be right... please let my robot make it!$2",

  "Events.DylanExpedition.NovaDylan.8": "We're well within the Abyssopelagic Zone by now. Permanent night. Faint bioluminescence is the only natural light that most of the fauna here ever see.$3#$b#Quite a few of them are completely blind. There's not that much use for eyes down here.$9",
  "Events.DylanExpedition.NovaDylan.9": "HOLY MOTHER OF CTHULHU!!",
  "Events.DylanExpedition.Maru.8": "Well, that thing certainly had eyes! It must've seen us, right??$9",
  "Events.DylanExpedition.NovaDylan.10": "Oh, it definitely saw us. But maybe we're too small to be worth capturing? Or perhaps the lights scared it off.$1#$b#That was too big to be a giant squid or even a colossal squid. I've got so many questions right now! I sure hope we see another one.$3",
  "Events.DylanExpedition.NovaDylan.11": "We finally made it to the Hadopelagic Zone! This is... oh, wow! I wasn't expecting to see so much life down here.$3",
  "Events.DylanExpedition.Maru.9": "It's just as well. I don't think we could've made it too much further down.$0",
  "Events.DylanExpedition.Demetrius.5": "It's so... primordial. That's the only word I can think of for it right now. We're looking at something that few humans have ever laid eyes on.$1",
  "Events.DylanExpedition.NovaDylan.12": "Just look at it all!",
  "Events.DylanExpedition.NovaDylan.13": "Giant tube worms! It's not surprising to see them here. There's a lot of hydrothermal vents for them to live near.$1#$b#Let's nab a few samples while we're passing through.$0",
  "Events.DylanExpedition.NovaDylan.14": "OH, for the LOVE of -!!",
  "Events.DylanExpedition.NovaDylan.15": "Seriously, Rodney? Not even the deepest, darkest fathoms of the ocean are safe from his mug! He and I are going to have a little chat later...$8",
  "Events.DylanExpedition.Maru.10": "Dylan? We're recording audio, you know. Let's take this with us, though...$0",
  "Events.DylanExpedition.Demetrius.6": "I've never heard of brine forming rivers like this! I must take more notes...$1#$b#Oh, drat. My pen's run out again!$2",
  "Events.DylanExpedition.Sigurd.2": "Here you go, Demetrius. I've got a spare.$1",
  "Events.DylanExpedition.Maru.11": "Unfortunately, the ROV isn't capable of diving under the brine. It's too dense, we'd just end up floating on top.$0#$b#And we'd better start heading back now if we're to have enough power to reach the surface.$3",
  "Events.DylanExpedition.NovaDylan.16": "No matter. We can always come back another time. For now, we have what we came for.$1",
  "Events.DylanExpedition.Demetrius.7": "Mission accomplished!",
  "Events.DylanExpedition.NovaDylan.17": "Fantastic work, everyone! We've got so many samples to take a look at later.$3",

  "Events.DylanArticle.Lewis.3": "All too well...",
  "Events.DylanArticle.Pierre.3": "Hello there!",
  "Events.DylanArticle.Lewis.4": "Ah, @! Have you seen this? Dylan, Demetrius and Maru did a magazine interview that got published today.$1",

  "Events.DylanArticle.NovaDylan.3": "I'll bear that in mind in the very unlikely scenario that that happens. But for now, I'm pretty {{LPProfanity_Damn}} proud of what we accomplished!$3",

  "Events.DylanArticle.Gunther.1": "Dr. Moray? I have taken the liberty of adding that edition of Deep Dive to the library's collection. For posterity.$0",

  "Olivia.Luau2": "Did you know, sweetie? Adding a little bit of sherry to some kinds of soups can make them taste extra delicious.$1#$e#And balsamic vinegar makes anything at all better.",
  "Olivia.Jellyfish2": "This is a very special kind of romantic, isn't it?$1#$e#There's nothing like this in the city.",
  "Olivia.Fair2": "Do they ever offer samples from the grange displays here?$1#$e#I'd love to take some local produce home and whip something special up.",

  "Marlon.Jellyfish2": "I wonder if the glowing jellyfish have stingers, too.$1#$e#Getting stung by a jellyfish is nasty. Avoid it if you can.",
  "Marlon.Fair2": "I only buy eggs and milk from Marnie's ranch.$1#$e#I hope she notices.",
  "Marlon.Halloween2": "When we catch these monsters, we have to figure out a balance between which will be interesting to look at, and which are safe enough to keep in the town.$1#$e#No matter how strong the cages are, you have to be prepared.",
  "Marlon.Ice2": "Some of these snowmen remind me of the monsters around here.$1#$e#Hopefully the young people don't see too many of them.",
  "Marlon.Christmas2": "Merry Winter Star, @. $1#$e#I hope you've found your place in this town.",
  "Gunther.Egg2": "How did a festival dedicated to eggs come into being in the first place, do you think...? We only have theories.$1#$e#Local customs are always strange to unpick.",
  "Gunther.Flower2": "The research we have about this dance suggests that it goes back hundreds of years.$1#$e#It's amazing how much stays the same over time in small towns like this one.",
  "Gunther.Luau2": "If the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, then this soup will be magnificent.",
  "Gunther.Jellyfish2": "No one understands precisely how the jellies get their glow, but research suggests that it's a combination of both biology and magic.",
  "Gunther.Fair2": "Do you prefer to perfect a few things on your farm and display the same ones every year? Or do you expand and show off the breadth of your farm's potential?$1#$e#Either way, you put on a formidable showing.",
  "Gunther.Halloween2": "This is the festival where the town looks most different from its usual self.$1#$e#Many things could lurk in the shadows.",
  "Gunther.Ice2": "Every inch of this valley has its own fascinating history.$1#$e#And the snow layers over it and hides it all. It's a strange feeling.",
  "Gunther.Christmas2": "May you have a very merry Winter Star.$1#$e#The tree looks larger than usual this year, I think.",
  "Martin.Egg2": "I wish I could egg-hunt too.$1#$e#I'm worried that I'll be no good at it.",
  "Martin.Flower2": "I've never even tried to dance.$1#$e#No, I don't want to learn! Not yet...",
  "Martin.Luau2": "There's so many things to eat here, I can hardly pick!$1#$e#That's it. I'm not gonna pick, I'm gonna try it all.",
  "Martin.Jellyfish2": "I never saw the jellies before I came to Pelican Town! We're way too far out from the ocean at home.",
  "Martin.Fair2": "Best of luck in the contest, @!$1#$e#Maybe someday I'll put up a grange display of my own.",
  "Martin.Halloween2": "Is it technically cheating to just climb over top of the maze?$1#$e#I'd prove that I'm *really* good at climbing.",
  "Martin.Ice2": "I'm gonna make the most powerful snowman the world has ever seen.",
  "Martin.Christmas2": "For my gift, I want...$1#$e#I'm not gonna tell you or my wish might not come true!",
